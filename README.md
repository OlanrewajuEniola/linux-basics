# Linux Basics — DevOps Training

This repository contains my hands-on Linux and Bash training as part of a structured DevOps roadmap.

The focus is on practical command-line usage, scripting, permissions, filesystem operations, and documentation discipline.

## Repository Structure

- `labs/` — Command practice and file operation exercises
- `scripts/` — Bash scripts and executable examples
- `notes/` — Dated learning notes and reflections
- `logs/` — Reserved for runtime or command output logs

## Progress

### Linux + Bash — Session 1 (22/12/2025)
- Practiced core Linux commands (`ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `chmod`, `grep`, `find`)
- Created and executed a Bash script
- Organised files into a reproducible repo structure
- Documented learnings in Markdown

## How to Run

Example:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/hello.sh
./scripts/hello.sh

# ci refresh
Testing branch protection

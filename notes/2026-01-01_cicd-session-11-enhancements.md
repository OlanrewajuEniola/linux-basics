# CI Enhancements — Session 11
Date: 2026-01-01

## Focus
Making CI pipelines configurable, secure, and debuggable.

## What I Did
- Added environment variables to workflow
- Created and referenced GitHub Actions secrets
- Intentionally failed and fixed a build
- Executed repository scripts inside CI
- Reviewed logs to understand pipeline behavior

## Key Concepts
- Env vars avoid hard-coded values
- Secrets must never be committed
- Failing fast improves feedback
- CI should reuse repo scripts where possible

# AWS Networking Fundamentals — Session 6
Date: 2025-12-29

## Focus
Understanding VPC, subnets, routing, and internet access in AWS.

## Key Concepts
- VPC is a private network in AWS
- Subnets divide a VPC and map to AZs
- Public subnets route to an Internet Gateway
- Private subnets do not expose resources directly
- Route tables control traffic flow

## Common Issues
- EC2 has no internet due to missing IGW or routes
- Public IP alone does not guarantee connectivity

## Notes
- Reviewed default VPC, subnets, route tables, and IGW
- No infrastructure changes made

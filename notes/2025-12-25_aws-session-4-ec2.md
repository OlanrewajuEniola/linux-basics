# AWS EC2 — Session 4
Date: 2025-12-25

## What I Did
- Launched an Ubuntu EC2 instance in eu-west-2
- Created and used an SSH key pair
- Connected to EC2 from macOS using SSH
- Ran system verification commands
- Updated the system using apt

## Commands Run
- whoami
- hostname
- uname -a
- df -h
- sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

## Key Concepts
- EC2 is a virtual server
- Key pairs secure SSH access
- Security groups control network access
- Ubuntu uses apt instead of yum

## Status
- Instance stopped after use to avoid charges
